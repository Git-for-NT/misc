prompt for IATF
"Explain Statistical Process Control (SPC) in full detail, leaving nothing out. Cover its purpose, the theory of variation (common vs. special causes), the full end-to-end workflow (measurement system analysis, subgrouping, baseline data, control limit calculation, monitoring, and reaction). Provide formulas for control charts (I-MR, X-bar & R, X-bar & S, p, np, c, u, EWMA, CUSUM), explain the logic of control limits, rational subgrouping, and Average Run Length (ARL). Include all standard signal rules (Western Electric rules), capability indices (Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk), and how to use them correctly only after stability is proven. Explain sampling strategies, subgroup size, and handling of non-normal or autocorrelated data. Discuss integration with IATF 16949 requirements, including how SPC links to PFMEA, control plans, MSA, and customer-specific requirements. Provide worked numerical examples, formulas, and tables where useful. Cover pitfalls, tampering, false alarms, misusing spec limits as control limits, and over-complication. End with a ready-to-use Out-of-Control Action Plan (OCAP) template and practical tips for shop-floor implementation. The answer should be comprehensive, structured, and self-contained."
